        <p class="title">Overview</p>
        <p>Over the course of eleven weeks, a team of six designers and developers worked on designing and implementing the redesign of the Amazon Prime Video App. This project adopted an iterative process, where we held three phases of usability testing
            and made necessary design changes in response to our findings. Through the testing, we received insightful and valuable feedback that contributed to enhancing the “Creating a New Profile” task flow, particularly the personalization process
            that now has five more pages in comparison to the Alpha state. The app is a fully coded webpage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. </p>

        <h2 id="subtitle">Background</h2>
        <p><b>Prime Video</b> is a video streaming service available for Amazon Prime members. It offers thousands of Prime titles for free, with the option to rent or buy movies and TV episodes not included with Prime Video. </p>
        <p><b>The Problem:</b> For our class, we were given the project of redesigning and implementing a functioning web-based app of the Prime Video app based on a previous redesign on Figma. Our task was to carry on with the redesign and make it functional
            with code and a database. The critical path we chose to focus on starts from the “Adding A New Profile” page until the “Home” page.
        </p>
        <p><b>Goal:</b> To design with usability testing a satisfactory user experience “Adding a New Profile” leading up to an intuitive "For You” homepage that is fully functional and dynamic with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL as a web-based app.
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b> To learn how to work in teams collaboratively and efficiently with management tools, and fully utilize all the skills we have learnt so far to successfully build this web-based app. </p>
        <p><b>Timeline:</b> The project spanned over 11 weeks with a strict timeline structure as outlined below. </p>

            Each of us were assigned a primary role which we were held fully accountable for, and a secondary role supporting the primary. The team consists of Project Managers, UX Designers, UI Designers, Data-Architects, Backend Developer and Frontend Developer.
            The UI and UX Designers worked closely together to conduct usability testing and design prototypes on Figma, while the Frontend and Backend coders worked closely to implement the final design. The whole team would formally meet every week
            after lecture to discuss, analyze findings, and decide on the next steps. Sub-teams such as just the UI/UX Designer would also meet when necessary.

            <br><br> As this project was done fully virtually due to COVID-19, our main communication channel was Microsoft Teams. Here we kept track of all of our progress: set tasks in the planner tab that was assigned a due date and a person(s), had
            group call meetings, archived all of our usability test videos and results, and created different group chats within the team such as “UI/UX,” or “Frontend” etc. Using Microsoft Team as a channel and workspace was a way to organize all our
            content and allow for efficient project management. It also was used for members to be up to date with other’s work.

            <br><br> To collaboratively work on the development of the app, we used GitHub where we created a team repository everyone has forked from and used either Source Tree GitHub Desktop to work on a local repository.

            <h2 id="subtitle">Role as Data Architect</h2>
            <p>
                As the primary data architect for the team, I worked on optimizing images, organizing the different files, and inputting them into the database for the backend developers. The role of a data architect is to establish and maintain a strong, secure, and
                well-managed electronic database for all of its contents and functions. This enables the rest of the project team to use and access the files. I also download the images that have been already uploaded into the GitHub repository by the
                designers and developers, optimize them for better loading, and then upload it back into the repo. The database is continually updated to meet team expectations and needs. This includes following agreed upon file-naming conventions and
                sizing dimensions.

            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, I was one of the two managers of our team GitHub repository where we stored all of our code. Each of the team members had repository access, and they forked it so that they could work and update the code on their side locally. The other data
                architect and I were the two collaborators of the repo, meaning that the other team members were able to submit pull requests but only the two of us had the ability to accept and merge the changes. This was especially useful since I worked
                on the design team, and the other data architect worked on the development team. There would often be changes on both sides, and it was helpful having someone from either team merge those changes whenever needed.

            <p>
                My secondary role on this team was UX designer. In this role, I worked closely with the other UX and UI designers to gather insights from our users and enhance the design. Some of the design changes I helped contribute to were the suggestion to add a
                closing screen to indicate to users that they had reached the end of their personalization process. I also developed the initial design for the choose profile page, as well as the dots for the carousel swiping feature. Other things I worked
                on were the thought process behind naming certain things on the app such as age ranges or section titles like “Prime Picks.” These changes brought more clarity to the users.
            </p>

            <p>
                As part of being a user experience designer, I also conducted usability testing sessions during the alpha and beta phases. Before the testing sessions, I supported the development of writing the interview questions based on changes we had implemented
                and things we still hoped to improve. These questions included rating the performance of different tasks, finding out user’s expectations, looking for pain points, and asking what should be improved. The usability testing questions were
                assembled into multiple choice questions through Microsoft Forms. I interviewed around ten people in total, ranging from fellow peers to adults who both had used the Prime Video app previously and were first time users. Following each
                phase of usability testing, I would meet with the other UX and UI designers to discuss our insights and findings for each question. We would take notes on particular ones of interest and write action steps for changes to implement depending
                if they were feasible. We conducted a session of card sorting during our beta testing phase as well. The purpose of the card sorting was to discover how our users would prefer the menu navigation to be ordered based on their mental models.
                I made the Figma version of this card sorting by making a simple artboard with colored “stickies” and a bottom row of boxes. During usability testing, I began with the card sorting exercise. I screen shared the Figma card sorting file
                and asked users which sticky to drag to which box according to the order they expected.

                <h2 id="subtitle2">THE FINAL PRODUCT </h2>
                <p>Looking at our project overall, we made considerable changes and improvement to our critical path. We added and implemented various features to create an engaging and personalized experience for our users. We relied heavily on data and
                    feedback from our usability testing phases to push us towards continuous iterations and revisions. These revisions drove us to expand our user personalization process to create a process that was overall more complete. By adding pages
                    for age, genre selection, and cultural preferences, we were able to hone in on and include more user interests. These would then help the user’s home page be specifically tailored according to the choices they had made. We also considered
                    the user during the personalization flow by implementing a progress bar so that they would know how far along they were in the process and how much they had left. In addition to that, we created additional screens to give users the
                    ability to skip by clicking “maybe later” or to “go back” in case they wanted to revise their responses. These same screens also increased user emotions through animations like a hand wave, welcoming them to their new profile or letting
                    them know they completed the process successfully. </p>
                <p>User experience design methods governed our design thinking throughout this project. Some highlights from these methods aside from our usability testing sessions include using card sorting and surveying potential users. We wanted to make
                    sure we were designing our product in a way that is intuitive to our users. We used a card sorting technique to pull responses about the order of our navigation structure. From it, we received helpful feedback which we used to restructure
                    our menu. Another form of user experience we used was through creating and sending out a survey. This was to promote user inclusivity for our cultural preferences, and we implemented the categories based on those comments.</p>
                <p>Lastly, we knew even little details should be clear to our users. With that in mind, we revised the names of our categories to avoid confusion on the personalization aspect of the product. We also changed the “My Stuff” page to “My Profile”
                    and made the critical path start from that page instead of the home.</p>
                <p>All in all, our final product is enhanced with setup personalization, micro interactions, and more clarity for a smooth and pleasant experience that tailors watch suggestions for each user.</p>

                Our implementation of the Amazon Prime App was an overall success. We were able to code out the mobile based app, including micro-interactions, front-end, and back-end coding. The critical path that we chose was fully implemented, and we added some new
                redesigns into the critical path as well. Each week we were able to dedicate our time to further redesign the app, performing a variety of different usability tests and making weekly updates to code out the entire mobile-based application.
                If we were to further develop this application in the future, we would make sure that all our micro interactions would be able to be functional when in a phone simulator instead of just having it function when the browser is sized down.
            </p>
            <p>During this project, our team faced the challenge of meeting during COVID-19 as well as having a team member with a 13-hour time difference. We overcame this challenge and met each week as a team at times that worked for all of us, as well
                as separate meetings amongst different members to make sure that our app was developed for its greatest potential. </p>
